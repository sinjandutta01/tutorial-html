    <p>When being joyful it’s a rush of happiness
        Thinking that</p>
        <p>As I’m dying of laughter
    All the joy starts to gather
    Friends making funny faces
    Even falling on their shoe laces
    Watching funny videos</p>
    <pre> almost choking on my cheerios

    Being at recess looking at other people’s 
    smiles
    But there joy ends once they step foot on the school tiles

    Joy must always live
    
    It is something you should give</pre>
